# Implementation-Analysis-of-the-Go-Back-N-Protocol-for-Reliable-Data-Transfer-over-Unreliable-Network
This project implements the Go-Back-N (GBN) protocol on top of UDP to enhance reliable data transfer in networks. GBN allows multiple packet transmissions without waiting for acknowledgments, ensuring data integrity despite potential packet loss and corruption.
